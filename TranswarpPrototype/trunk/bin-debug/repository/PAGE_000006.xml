			<li>A sophisticated network of <font color="#FF0000" size="22" face="Courier New">vessels</font> connects with the heart and lungs so that the entire body can be maintained and sustained with oxygen rich blood.</li>
			<li>Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, while veins return unoxygenated blood to the heart.</li>
			<li>Note that the superior vena cava returns blood from the head and arms while the inferior vena cava returns blood from the trunk and legs.</li>
			<li>Unoxygenated blood enters the heart filling the right atrium passing through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.</li>
			<li>It is pumped out of the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery and into the lungs where it is re-oxygenated.</li>
			<li>Next the pulmonary vein receives oxygenated blood and fills the left atrium, passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, where it is pumped out to the body through the aorta, the largest artery in the body.</li>
